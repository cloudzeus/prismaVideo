# Video Conference Recording Testing Guide

This guide will help you test and verify that video conference recordings are properly saved to Bunny CDN.

## üéØ What We're Testing

1. **Stream.io Recording API** - Start/stop recording during video calls
2. **Webhook System** - Automatic processing when recordings are ready
3. **Bunny CDN Integration** - Automatic upload and storage of recordings
4. **Database Storage** - Recording metadata and URLs stored in database

## üöÄ Quick Test Steps

### 1. **Navigate to Test Page**
Go to `/test-recording` in your application to access the recording test dashboard.

### 2. **Check Environment Variables**
Verify these environment variables are set:
- ‚úÖ `STREAM_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `STREAM_SECRET` 
- ‚úÖ `STREAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- ‚úÖ `BUNNY_ACCESS_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `BUNNY_STORAGE_ZONE`
- ‚úÖ `BUNNY_CDN_URL`
- ‚úÖ `BUNNY_STORAGE_URL`

### 3. **Test Recording Flow**
Click "Test Recording Flow" button to simulate:
- Starting a recording
- Stopping a recording
- Webhook processing
- Bunny CDN upload

## üîß Stream.io Configuration

### **Webhook Setup**
1. Go to your Stream.io dashboard
2. Navigate to **Webhooks** section
3. Add new webhook endpoint:
   ```
   URL: https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stream
   Events: call.ended, call.recording.ready, call.transcription.ready, call.livestream.ready
   ```

### **Recording Permissions**
Ensure your Stream.io plan supports recording functionality.

## üìπ Testing in Real Video Conference

### **Start a Video Conference**
1. Create or join a meeting
2. Navigate to the meeting room
3. Look for the recording button (circle/square icon)

### **Start Recording**
1. Click the recording button (circle icon)
2. You should see "Recording Started" toast
3. Recording status should show "Recording" badge

### **Stop Recording**
1. Click the recording button again (square icon)
2. You should see "Recording Stopped" toast
3. Status should change to "Processing"

### **Check Webhook Processing**
1. Monitor your application logs
2. Look for webhook events:
   ```
   Stream webhook event: call.recording.ready
   Recording processed and uploaded to Bunny CDN: [recording_id]
   ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Verification

### **Check Recordings Table**
Query your database to see recordings:
```sql
SELECT * FROM recordings ORDER BY createdAt DESC;
```

### **Expected Fields**
- `id` - Unique recording ID
- `callId` - Associated meeting ID
- `streamRecordingId` - Stream.io recording ID
- `title` - Recording title
- `status` - Status (recording ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed)
- `bunnyCdnUrl` - Final CDN URL (after processing)
- `duration` - Recording duration in seconds
- `fileSize` - File size in bytes

## üåê Bunny CDN Verification

### **Check File Storage**
1. Go to your Bunny CDN dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** ‚Üí **Your Storage Zone**
3. Look for `recordings/[companyId]/` folder
4. Verify MP4 files are present

### **Check CDN URLs**
1. In your test page, look for "Bunny CDN URL" links
2. Click on the URL to verify the video plays
3. URLs should look like: `https://cdn.bunny.net/[zone]/recordings/[company]/recording-[id]-[timestamp].mp4`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Recording Won't Start**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user has recording permission (host/admin)
- Check Stream.io API credentials
- Ensure meeting has valid `streamCallId`

### **Webhook Not Receiving Events**
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check webhook secret matches environment variable
- Ensure webhook events are enabled in Stream.io
- Check application logs for webhook errors

### **Bunny CDN Upload Fails**
- Verify Bunny CDN credentials
- Check storage zone exists and is accessible
- Ensure sufficient storage space
- Check network connectivity to Bunny CDN

### **Database Records Missing**
- Check Prisma connection
- Verify database schema matches expectations
- Check for database errors in logs
- Ensure user has proper permissions

## üìä Monitoring and Logs

### **Application Logs**
Look for these log messages:
```
Stream webhook event: call.recording.ready
Recording processed and uploaded to Bunny CDN: [recording_id]
Bunny CDN upload error: [error details]
```

### **Stream.io Dashboard**
- Check **Calls** section for recording status
- Monitor **Webhooks** for delivery status
- Review **Analytics** for recording metrics

### **Bunny CDN Dashboard**
- Monitor **Storage** usage
- Check **CDN** performance
- Review **Analytics** for file access

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

### **Complete Flow Success**
1. ‚úÖ Recording starts successfully
2. ‚úÖ Recording stops successfully  
3. ‚úÖ Webhook received (`call.recording.ready`)
4. ‚úÖ File downloaded from Stream.io
5. ‚úÖ File uploaded to Bunny CDN
6. ‚úÖ Database record updated with `bunnyCdnUrl`
7. ‚úÖ Email notifications sent to participants
8. ‚úÖ Recording accessible via CDN URL

### **Expected File Structure**
```
Bunny CDN Storage:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [storage-zone]/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ recordings/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [company-id]/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recording-[call-id]-[timestamp].mp4
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recording-[call-id]-[timestamp].mp4
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
